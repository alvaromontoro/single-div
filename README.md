# single-div

Inspired by super-talented [Lynn Fisher](https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic)'s [A Single Div](https://a.singlediv.com/) website, and with Divtober fastly approaching, I compiled many of the single-element CSS art that I have coded over the past few years into a single site: https://cssdrawings.com.

This repository holds the code for the CSS Drawings site :)

The initial version of the page has over 90 CSS drawings, all coded with a single HTML element (which is not always a div). Here are some features:

- Responsive grid layout
- Live CSS drawings (**there is not a single image on the web page!**)
- Accessibility features:
   - "Alternative text" for each drawing
   - Focus indicator on interactive items
   - Animations disabled by default
